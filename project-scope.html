	<h1>Research Project Scope</h1>
		<h2>Literature Survey</h2>


				There are many works in the literature that explains about expert systems, Disease identification systems and recommendation systems.
<br><br>	 Recommendation system<br><br>
				G. Linden, B. Smith, and J. York proposed [1] Item-to-item collaborative filtering matches each of the user's purchased and rated items to related items, then combines those related items into a recommendation list, rather than matching the user to similar customers. The algorithm creates a related items table by identifying items that customers frequently purchase together to determine the most similar match for a given item. By iterating through all item pairs and computing a similarity metric for each pair, they developed product-to-product matrix.
				J. Wang, A. P. De Vries, and M. J. Reinders proposed recommendation system with [2] user-based and item-based collaborative filtering approaches and algorithm to unify. They demonstrated that user-based and item-based approaches are two distinct approaches. In probabilistic fusion framework, other ratings by using a linear interpolation smoothing similar users' responses to related items can be used as a background model to smooth rating predictions. Experiments have shown that their new fusion framework works. In collaborative filtering prediction accuracy and dealing with the data sparsity problem.
				<br><br>

				 Expert Systems<br><br>

				This paper [4] has experimented orchid plants, according to the communication of plant and humans, apply a chat-bot algorithm for sending/receiving messages between users and automated smart farming, Natural language processing (NLP) parses and interprets the messages to determine the meaning of the conversation and this system will assist farmers in recognizing the health of orchids, which is one of the significant benefits of automatic smart farming. The steps they took to build the Chabot are as follows:[4] Translate crisp inputs to Fuzzy sets, create knowledge base rules, simulate human reasoning, Transform the Fuzzy sets into a crisp output, Control actuators, Loop control.

				This paper proposed [5] conversational agent to meet the information needs of farmers in rural India. The system was limited to potatoes when it was implemented. [5] An overview of the system, the generated knowledge base derived from the KCC dataset and inputs from agriculture experts, and the conversational intelligence combining intents, entities, dialogue and back-end application built with python flask.

				 	 Disease identification<br><br>

				Shrikant has proposed floriculture classification using a Simple Neural Network [6]. Paper [7] proposed CNN based plant disease detection approach. However, Sharada Prasanna Mohanty- et al, proposed Deep Learning with Image-Based plant disease detection approach which they have achieved 99.3% accuracy for a publicly available dataset of 14 crop species and 26 diseases [9]. Another approach presented by [8] leaf image classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) has better accuracy..

				Plant leaf disease detection-based research was done by identifying the urgent need for crop disease identification to reduce crop agriculture losses [14]. Android mobile application developed for the agriculturist to upload their disease image to predict and crop monitoring. Deep learning technique, CNN used with 96,206 images of plant leaves of healthy and infected. This research provided a better opportunity for farmers to identify disease categories with a 94% confidence percentage that help farmers to stop using wrong fertilizers that will stress plants.



			</p> <br>
			<h2>Research Gap</h2><br>

				it was evident that the floriculture industry does not adapt to these technologies because of available data and other resources not adequate.
				<br>
				<br>

				Recommendation system will automatically select acceptable flower options, or the user can select flowers based on their tastes. When compared to using an automated technique, this procedure eliminates the issues that emerge when doing it manually. This helper agent system is easy to maintain, trustworthy, efficient, accessible, and user-friendly, all of which are advantageous in the production of vast quantities of flowers. To build this system, each team member takes a different strategy, and they must each perform their own tasks. and make recommendations for floral and floriculture services that have been discovered, as well as learn from user preferences and update the system on a regular basis, in addition, sophisticated demand forecasting is available.
				<br>
				<br>

				There was no research conducted specifically classifying flower diseases with deep learning technologies such as CNN and DCNN. Further, to detect any flower plant diseases or insects damaged to flowers and provide intelligent solutions and guide floriculturists to mitigate/prevent those diseases. Moreover, none of the research provides all those facilities for mobile applications with capability of instant capturing and uploading to get more than 90% accuracy result.
				<br>
				<br>

				To the best of the researcher's knowledge, no research has been done to design a knowledge-based system that can address user questions about floriculture. According to the available research papers [2]-[4] and resources there are several research developed on the knowledge-based systems related to floriculture industry. Research is concerned different type of problems related floriculture. (Table 1)
				<br>
				<br>

				Research â€˜Aâ€™ [2] was unable to provide a solution for diseases. Only provide solutions for problems in the orchid plant relating to temperature, humidity soil moisture and sunlight in the orchid plant. These Fuzzy values must be evaluated by Fuzzy Logic already. Next, Orchid Chatbot retrieves environment information from Blynk serves. And the system is focused on a single flower (orchid). Research â€˜Bâ€™ [3] can only provide temperature control for greenhouse rose production. It provides daytime and nighttime temperature control. And it could not provide disease-related solutions or respond to cultivators' various floriculture-related problems, and the system is only limited to one flower (rose). Research â€˜Câ€™ [4] FarmChat system was limited to potatoes and three areas of relevant research are used: Conversational systems, user interfaces for low-literate users, and agricultural-related technology
				<br>
				<br>

				There is no research conducted to design a knowledge-based system for floriculture diseases Treatment and provide solutions for cultivatorâ€™s quires. The proposed system fills the gap in existing research by providing solutions to various diseases and answering the Questions of cultivator's various problems related to floriculture by equipped knowledge of a floriculture expert.
				<br>
				<br>


Lack of proper transportation service in countries such as Sri Lanka was not addressed in modern technologies[12]. The research shows location based clustering using DBSCAN which arise as floriculture product user have not proper transportation. Our Smart Intelligent Assistant agent suggest best route to delivery drivers who deliver the final product to the customer. To reduce complexity in coordination between relevant stakeholders our system instructs to select user type as required to identify and track information as follows, by selecting user type and to each userâ€™s unique problem the system provide the best new suggestions.
<br>

				<br>

Moreover, none of the abovementioned research was targeted entire floriculture industry as an intelligent assistant which will identify diseases and guide, suggest remedies, and necessary decisions to take. Combination of user-based clustering with a recommendation technique were not considered by previously mentioned research. The proposed solution fills the unfiled gap between floriculture industry and modern technology by   this research.

				<h2>Research Problem</h2><br>

					The current state and future prospects of the Sri Lankan floriculture sector" are still looking for new and inventive ways to improve the industry through technology. [1] Despite the fact that Sri Lanka's floriculture sector has been around for a long time, a viable local market for floricultural products has yet to emerge. In addition, there is no integrated method for providing farmers with inputs, knowledge, information, and technology as a whole.
					<br>
					<br>

					[9] Sri Lanka has lost its share of the export market to the main importing countries as a result of numerous inadequacies in the national economy. The floriculture industry's rivals, difficulties, and risks were better understood according to data and input from important stakeholders.
					<br>
					<br>

					Growing concerns in the floriculture industry begins from the beginning of the industry. Existing cultivators have been suffering from various humidity situations and newly identified and existing diseases are spreading throughout plants. Issues have risen with insects demolishing plants and flowers, lack of knowledge and industry experts supports, available resources and insufficient information and the inability to reach, etc. which predicts eventual inability to cater the supply for the demand. Furthermore, there are more barriers such as the production cost and selling cost for cultivated products being steep due to not knowing the trend and consumer demand.
					<br>
					<br>

					Even if there are industries (ex: Lassana Flora), government support, agriculturists for this domain, they are not available and accessible always everywhere, as individual not possess all the knowledge in this domain and some new diseases can be occur. In this situation experts support is needed, so to finding the disease and solutions will take longer time.
					<br>
					<br>

					There are now a number of smartphone apps and platforms that provide help for making floriculture product recommendations. However, in the event of an emergency, most of them have material hardcoded for a lower quantity. Some of them provide it as a human-assisted service. However, many services are not always available or take a long time to finish due to a lack of resources. This isn't the place to be if you need to make a quick decision.
					<br>
					<br>

					<h2>Research Objectives<h2>
<h3>	Main Objective</h3>
Main objective of the study is to design and develop Smart Intelligent Floriculture Assistant Agent.

<h3>
	Specific Objectives
</h3>
Below are specific objectives that will help achieve the overall objective of the study,<br>
<br>
<h3> Classification of diseases in the Ornamental Plants.</h3>


					The main objective is ornamental plant disease identification using the DCNN deep learning technique to facilitate floriculturists in farming and cultivation to get the maximum potential of production at a lower cost. Floriculturists must identify disease in time to avoid huge losses in production and money. Disease identifier required to provide instant results with higher accuracy.
					<br>	<br>
					Since CNN require a larger dataset for achieving higher accuracy. Which is requires computational power to feature extraction and classification. Avoiding fore mentioned situation using publicly available images collection and expansion with augmentation techniques to train the DCNN model with lower computational power.
					<br>	<br>
					Firstly, using web scrapping techniques collecting publicly available images to create a dataset without manually reproducing disease in a prepared area was considered. Secondly, expanding that collection dataset to make the model performant and accurate data augmentation techniques applied. CNN is used to avoid manual feature extraction in images and classify images with high accuracy. Lastly, the trained model is integrated into an API that bridges the mobile application that will eventually support accessibility and availability to floriculturists.

					<br>	<br>

<h3>	Recommendation system with HCI aspects. </h3>


					Consumers who interested in floriculture searching for products for their expectations and difficult to find each of them as it is very time taking and complex. It also needs more reliable method. The needed quality of product is high. So, this marketing based automated flower suggestion system is a good method to avoid such problems as Consumers can get products on their own. And give users to satisfy their expectations. And support to user personalized behavior.

					<br>	<br>

					<h3>	Knowledge base system. </h3>
					The main objective of the study is to design and develop a knowledge-based system that can offers a categorized solution for disease as an additional, it will provide answers for userâ€™s questions related floriculture by using acquired tacit knowledge of an expert.
<br>
					<h3>User Based Tracking System using Optimization Techniques.</h3>
					Implementing SIFAA which track buyers and sellers through optimization techniques throughout the year is the major concern and component discussed in this report. Location based clustering used to track location of floriculture users using K-mean Clustering and Hierarchical clustering and finally find optimal cluster of markers for fulfilled optimization techniques. Shortest distance delivery route path obtained through a Dijkstra algorithm.
<br><br>
						<h2>Methodology</h2><br>
							RESTful API was built to communicate with mobile application and to integrate between all the features which are based on different technologies. API development carried out with Flask framework and feature wise generated files are imported as libraries to process data and request that flow from mobile application. Data communication format was JSON between API and mobile application.
							<br>
							<br>
							Android mobile application was built to facilitate implemented functionalities to end-user. The Retrofit library that is a type-safe REST client which we were used to send and receive JSON formatted data from mobile to API. Android SDK built in camera, location services, storage, etc. To bring functionalities with rich UI set. Further, Google MAP API used to provide shops locations of location clusters and Firebase real-time database, authentication and storage used to store user related content and shop related content, to login and application dependent images are stored, respectively
							<br>
							<br>
							Floriculturists can install SIFAA, the mobile application on their smartphone. The downloaded Android application is connected to AWS-hosted Python Flask RESTful API. When a floriculturist captured an image from the implemented feature or device gallery, it will display within the application that the person can upload. The uploaded image pre-process within the API as a multipart object which we are converting to a python file object and stored for future model improvements. Next, the image is pre-processed to match the input requirements of the trained deep learning model. After classification, the image using the TensorFlow'sâ€˜ Keras front-end will evaluate the result that we have generated a JSON response including classification result to send back to the mobile application. Retrofit consumes the result response generated by API and displaying in a new screen shown in Figure 4.1.2. The displayed results contain the disease name and synonyms of the disease and two buttons to connect the knowledge-based system to carry the guidance, remedies, and other assistance if the floriculturist requires further support. If the floriculturist decides to take the assistant, pressing on appropriate button will send another HTTP request with JSON request payload containing disease name, symptoms, and other information to the RESTful API. Then, the API is implemented to consume this request and process the details and input to the knowledge-based system.
							<br>
							<br>
							Recommendation system and demand forecasting

This function was primarily concerned with user interactions and behavior. Based on their customized preferences and HCI factors, different clients find different sorts of flowers. The system keeps track of the user's location to obtain weather, orders, and purchasing history, as well as to recommend user expectations and items. Under HCI principles, the system provides a better user experience by identifying and filtering for specific users, as well as navigating all areas of the system under HCI aspects. After analyzing the interactions of new items, automate them. The Flask API is being used for the deployment. Retrofit APIs and coroutines are used to write and implement all validation mechanisms. When the machine learning model tracks every activity on the mobile app, API methods are used to assign and assess user interface buttons, text views, and text boxes. Recycler is in charge of all certified floriculture productions. In Recycler view adapters, all validations are assigned to JSON string attributes, and all user behavior and preferences are appended to JSON attributes via an array list. The flask API connects all of the platforms. Data is communicated to the backend when a user logs in to the system, which returns all of the trained values. The mobile app is directly connected to the Firebase real-time database, allowing it to get required data using machine learning models' trained data. The demand forecasting graphs and recommended items are still being forecasted by the model.
<br>
							<br>There is no research conducted to design a knowledge base chatbot for floriculture diseases Treatment and provide solutions for cultivatorâ€™s quires. The proposed system fills the gap in the existing research by providing solutions to various diseases and answering the various questions of cultivators on problems related to floriculture by equipped knowledge of a floriculture expert. Knowledgebase is constructed to store expert knowledge and chatbot is integrate with it to answer the farmerâ€™s questions. Chabot is developed using RASA framework and knowledge base is develop using Typeql language which is provided by TypeDB. The System diagram shown in below

							<br><br>
							This is the functionality of SIFAA that track user according to the cluster of floriculture users location and using Floriculture marketplace location as dataset  to achieve Geolocation Data with clustering functionality using K-Means clustering and depicts (DBSCAN) which discovers clusters of various shapes and sizes from data containing noise and outliers and HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) which achieve DBSCAN over varying epsilon values and integrates the result to find a clustering that gives the best stability over epsilon.
