				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>Technology has become a vital aspect of functioning the world, for various functional purposes throughout the world. while And some industries like floriculture have not adapted technology to get satisfaction to solve and facilitate currently facing problems and provide the supply to the demand. Consequently, we have identified and implemented a solution that will address major aspects of this industry barrier. To address these major aspects we proposed a system Smart Intelligent Floriculture Assistant Agent (SIFAA), which uses expert knowledge with solutions and guidelines such as identifying diseases based on deep learning techniques. It also suggests remedies for diseases based on expert knowledge, recommends the best products for customers by using the Reinforcement Learning (RL) technique, motivate cultivators by using demand forecasting, and apply feature engineering by using Linear Regression (LR) and ensemble advanced LightGBM Regressors techniques.</p>

				<div class="survey-intro">
					<p>We have conducted a survey to get feedback from floriculturists to find out the importance of proposed IT based solution to identified problems.</p>

				<h2>Research Problems</h2>
				<p>We have identified following research problems in floriculture industry.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="swot">

				<div class="center">

					<div class="strengths">
						<h4>Disease Identifier</h4>
						<p>How does a mobile application can help floriculturists to identify diseases in Flowers easily, any time at any where?
							Will Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) provide best results for identification of diseases in Flowers images?
							Is it possible to train CNN model to achieve more than 80% accuracy with 50% data augmentation.
							Can a deep neural network be trained in low computational power without using cloud based solution (Ex: Dell I7 2.1 GHz laptop without using Colab)
							</p>
					</div>

					<div class="weaknesses">
						<h4>Knowledge Base</h4>
						<p>Can mobile application help customers to get automated recommendations of related flowers instead of spending days thinking which flower can grow in their garden without any disease.
							Can automated system recommend flower products to customers personalized behavior. Similar behavior by other users?
							Can  application support customers to collect their favorite product list and get updated & take any note they need instead of going shop to shop by memorizing every single detail their head?
							</p>
					</div>

					<div class="opportunities">
						<h4>Recommendation System & Demand Forecasting</h4>
						<p>many growers do not know how to treat the disease and they seek specialized expertise. Agricultural specialist assistance may not always be available and accessible when farmers need it.
							in some cases, farmers will only be able to contact an agricultural specialist after 2-3 weeks, allowing diseases to spread even further.
							Flower production is affected by a variety of diseases. Also, the consequences of extreme heat, cold, sudden rainfall with storms, Geographical zone that is suitable. Affect flower production during the flowering season.
							Solution : this study presents a knowledge based system for floriculture. That has capability of assist user with How to deal with plant diseases. Advisory based on weather forecasting. Optimal harvest times. Geographical zone that is suitable etc.
							</p>
					</div>

					<div class="threats">
						<h4>Location Base Clustering</h4>
							<p>Some of the key problems in supply chain in floriculture industry of Sri-Lanka can be explained as follows,
								Lack of market information -Floriculture product buyers can’t directly contact sellers through smart instructor like our system at present.
								Due to the lack of market information floriculture users have big problem to find location of the best floriculture product and sometimes it’s very difficult to find shortest distance locations of products that selling by sellers
								Transportation of floricultural products-at present users faced some obstacles to deliver their products.
								Lack of coordination between relevant stakeholders-present floriculture market if seller cancel order it may took long time to inform buyer and it cause lot of issues.
								</p>

				<h2>Research Objectives</h2>
				<p>System offers a categorized solution for disease as an additional, it will provide answers for user’s questions related floriculture by using acquired tacit knowledge of an expert.</p>

				<p>Provide marketing based  automated recommendation system with products to satisfy customer expected products, And support to user personalized behavior. Similar behavior by other users.</p>

				<p>Implement a smart flower disease detector using Convolutional Neural Network to provide more than 80% classification accuracy which Floriculturist can use with their smartphone camera.</p>

				<h2>Methodology</h2>
				<p>The research outcome is an intelligent assistant which facilitates the floriculture industry  where the core requirements are cultivating and selling harvested products. The SIFAA was developed to answer farmers’ cultivation queries, flower diseases identification, and predict the sales and demand. Furthermore, the system supports personalized behavior with the floriculture products recommendation. To facilitate these functionalities system comprises three components as follows,</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Floriculture disease detection using DCNN.</li>
					<li>Question and Answering as a human-counterpart.</li>
					<li>Automated floriculture product recommendation with demand forecasting.</li>
					<li>Using specific optimize algorithm to reach optimization the system.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Android application was built to facilitate implemented functionalities to end-user. Flask framework used as a bridge between the mobile application and above-mentioned functionalities Fig.1 shows the system architecture.</p>

				<h2>Result & Discussion</h2>
				<p>We have achieved state-of-the-art accuracy of 92.73% for the medium-scale testing dataset flower disease identification for our deployed model. We observed that even when the iteration count is 60, the loss has reduced to 0.1123 (12.3%). Following Table I represents the last 5 iterations of the model training accuracy and output of loss function as percentage.</p>

				<p>This proposed system responds to most farmers’ inquiries. Farmers can use natural language sentences to ask questions, as shown in Fig.10. The system will process the user's question and retrieve the relevant response from the knowledge base. Depending on the results found the main strength of the prototype system are</p>

				<p>The system was deployed in 10 test devices with users who already registered to the system and with new users as well. After we analyzed the behavior of the recommendation system according to the specific user, it was successfully tested for the basic operations.  Proposed recommendation system provides floriculture products under every action by the relevant user, the model is based on user actions, the actions are considered as one episode in mobile application where the  max size of episode state is 5, with a. 98.9% accuracy.</p>

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>In this research, a proposed SIFAA was presented for helping farmers in the floriculture field. System provides most appropriate solution for diseases along with answers for user’s questions related to the floriculture by using acquired tacit knowledge of an expert and is capable of recommending most demanding flowers. Furthermore, the availability of diagnosing flower specific diseases has been maximized, since there is no human intervention   enabling to gain a higher level of accuracy.</p>
